# TradeTycoon
Stock Market Simulation Application for iOS

This application has been developed by a team of Eastern Michigan University students in the 481W Software Engineering Class.

Trade Tycoon is meant to be a learning tool for anyone thinking about investing in the stock market.

Using historic stock market data, we guide the user through an easy simulation of stock trading to show how easily money can be lost.
